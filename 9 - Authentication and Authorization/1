This section is all about Authentication and Authorization.
We will add the ability for users to register, log in and log out.

We will learn about:

- JSON Web Tokens
- Calling Protected APIs
  (The endpoints that require user to be logged in or need permissions)
- Showing/Hiding Elements
  (Depending on users permission)
- Protecting Routes
  (So users cannot navigate to certain parts of Application if not authenticated or authorized)
