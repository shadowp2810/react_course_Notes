The application backend has an endpoint to register users.

http://localhost:3900/api/users

We POST to it the following properties
which the endpoint in current implementation
expects to recieve.
{
"email": "user1@domain.com",
"password": "123456",
"name": "Mosh",
}

We are returned
{
"\_id": "61ae3408d9e607242aed7373",
"name": "Mosh",
"email": "user1@domain.com"
}
Pasword is not here for security reasons.

Sending the above initial request again returns
"User already registered."
with status 400 which means bad request.

When you build backends you need endpoint to recieve users,
and it should respong with 200 or 400.
So now we have an understanding
of how the client and server will communitcate
in registration of new user.
