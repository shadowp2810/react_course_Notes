We use Higher Order Components
to reuse logic across components.

Supose you have a square and you hover over it which shows a tool tip,
and when you take cursor away from it it dissapears.
To implement this you need some kind of state,
like a boolean flag like show tool tip.
Next we need mouse events like mouse over and mouse out,
so in our event handelers we change state,
and reset value of boolean field.
Somewhere in this component we need to conditonially render tool tip,
depending on value of tool tip flag.
Suppose you have two more squares, and you need to implement same with them.
If there is a bug in our implementation, we have to change every single component.
We use higher order components to solve this problem.

We create a new function and pass this to the component.
And function creates a new component that wraps original component.
And in this bigger comonent we wrap all the functionality for showing tool tip.
Another example is having multiple components fetching data from backend.
When fetching data we want to show a loading icon.
We implement this common logic inside this wraper component.
And with this we no long have to repeat it across different components.
