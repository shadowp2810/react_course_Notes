In the vidly-api-node directory we go to terminal
and type command "heroku create"
It creates a random name for application,
a url its hosted on,
and a git url where we can remotely push changes.
Whenever we push new code to this repository,
heroku will be notified,
it will download the latest source code, build it, and deploy to address.
Called continuous integration.
"git push heroku master" to push code from local git to heroku repository.
Where master is name of current branch.
"heroku open" to open application.
This has an error so we need to log and fix it.
