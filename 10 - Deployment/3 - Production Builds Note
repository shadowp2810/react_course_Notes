We use "npm start" to start our application.
This gives a development build which is not optimised,
because the javascript bundle it generates includes additional code,
that helps debug our application.
But when we deploy our application to production,
we don't want all that extra code.
We want an optimized production build.
To get that we run "npm run build"
This creates an optimized production build, which might take a few mins.
In our project folder we have a new folder "build".
We can basically get content of folder and send it to server using ftp.
To test the build on machine we can install package serve
"sudo npm install -g serve",
which is a lightweight web server.
And with commoand "serve -s build" we can serve content of build folder.
It might serve the application at localhost:5000,
