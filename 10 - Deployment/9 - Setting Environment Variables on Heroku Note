We copy the connection stream from mlab or atlas.
We repace dbuser and dbpassword section.
user:password@ds...
On terminal we want to store this as an environment variable on heroku.
"heroku config:set vidly_db=mongodb+srv://vidlyuser:<password>@vidly.mkjdc.mongodb.net/myFirstDatabase?retryWrites=true&w=majority"

Now we make a small change to application,
In config folder, custom-environment-variables.json,
we add "db" : "vidly_db"
Development environment setting are in default.json.

we "git add ."
"git commit -m "Added support for reading connection string from an environemnt variable."
"git push heroku master"
This notifies heroku to rebuild and redeploy.



Steps to follow to fix issues.

"npm update mongoose"
Latest mongoose as of 5/01/2021 is mongoose 5.11.10. If there is a newer version please check the documentation.

Open db.js in startup folder.

Change "mongoose.connect(db)" to
"mongoose.connect(db, {useNewUrlParser:true, useUnifiedTopology: true})"

copy the connection string for Node driver version 2.2.12 or later.
make sure the connection string does not have (mongodb+srv)
copied connection string for node driver version 2.2.12 will look like as shown below.

mongodb://<username>:<password>@vidlycluster-shard-00-00.knv7y.mongodb.net:27017,vidlycluster-shard-00-01.knv7y.mongodb.net:27017,vidlycluster-shard-00-02.knv7y.mongodb.net:27017/<dbname>?ssl=true&replicaSet=atlas-8ezfa5-shard-0&authSource=admin&retryWrites=true&w=majority
Replace “password” with the password for the “username” user. Replace “dbname” with the name of the database that connections will use by default.
Once replaced, remove all the angle brackets.

Head over to heroku dashboad,
→Settings → Click on “Reveal Config Vars” → Enter the Key as vidly_db, value will the connection mongodb connection string.

Back to terminal,
git add .
git commit -m “Commit message”
git push heroku master
heroku open
