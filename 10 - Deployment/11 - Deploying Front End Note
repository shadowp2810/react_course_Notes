We add a .gitignore which ignores node_modules/
"git init"
"git add"
"git commit - m "Initial commit"

Heroku has build packs for node.js, java, go, ...
But not for applications generated by create-react-app.
We use another buildpack.
"heroku create --buildpack https://github.com/mars/create-react-app-buildpack.git"
"heroku open"
