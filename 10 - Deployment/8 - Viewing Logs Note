On Heroku dashboard we see the application.
Under more we have view logs,
alternatively we use terminal.
Inside backend folder "heroku logs"
You might see Mongo Network error, 
failed to connect to server localhost:27017 on first connect.
This is default port for mongodb.
Open up config folder,
inside default.json, db property is set to address on mongo on local machine.
We need to change this to server addres on mlab or atlas. 
We must never store the password on here 
and instead store as environment variable on heroku using terminal.
