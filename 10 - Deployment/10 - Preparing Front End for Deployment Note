In root of react app we add new file ".env.production"
In it we write 
"REACT_APP_API_URL=<address of heroku host>"
We make sure address ends with api.

In ".env.development" we write
"REACT_APP_API_URL=<address from config.json>"
We remove all references of config address,
eg: "const apiEndpoint = apiUrl + "/auth"",
    to "const apiEndpoint = "/auth""

We make same changes to 
authService, genreService, movieService, userService.
On top of httpService we add
"axios.defaults.baseURL = process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL;"
This will be replaced with a different value 
depnding on how we build the application.(dev,test,prod)

We can test locally before pushing to heroku.
Before that we need to remove from movies.jsx "if (count===0) return ..."

"npm run build"
"serve -s build"
