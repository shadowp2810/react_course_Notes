Before modifying our Vidly application
to talk to node backend,
lets quickly make sure we can successfully make a movie
by sending a http request to the movies endpoint.
To do this we will use Postman.

In Postman you can send
various http requests
to any given endpoint.
In Postman open a new tab
and type http://localhost:3900/api/movies
First we send a GET request
which gives us the array of movies objects with its properties.
Now we change to POST request,
go to body and add a new movie object,
select raw and change type of request to JSON.
Remember in JSON all strings are in quotes.
We make sure to use a valid genreID.
{
"title": "Airplane 2 Sequel",
"numberInStock": 2,
"dailyRentalRate": 4,
"genreId": "61acf5ab2f7771220951017e"
}
You get a response "Access denied, no token provided."
We will look at authorization later,
but for now there is a config file included where you can turn it on or off,
not how it should be done in production.

Go to folder "config" in "vidly-api-node",
and there go to "default.json",
and change to false
"requiresAuth": true
This lets you modify the data without having to authenticate.
Save changes and rerun `node index.js`

Going back to postman and rerunning it gives us status 200,
and the movie object and its properties we added,
with its own unique identifier id.
