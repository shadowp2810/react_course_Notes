Head over to https://brew.sh/ ,
Homebrew is a package manager for MacOS, similar to npm.

`brew tap mongodb/brew`
`brew install mongodb-community@5.0`

By default mongodb stores data in directory /data/db
so in app directory
`sudo mkdir -p /data/db`
If doesn't work, for newer osx versions
`sudo mkdir -p /System/Volumes/Data/data/db`

If you need to open bash profile on mac with textedit
`touch ~/.bash_profile; open ~/.bash_profile`

To make configure the right permissions for data directory
`sudo chown -R `id -un` /data/db`
or
`sudo chown -R `id -un` /System/Volumes/Data/data/db`

We need to run mongo daemon
which is a service that runs in background
and listens for connections on a given port.
`mongod` which is short for mongo daemon.
or `sudo mongod --dbpath=/System/Volumes/Data/data/db`
Gives message "msg":"Waiting for connections","attr":{"port":27017,"ssl":"off"}"

We get https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass
which is a client application to connect to mongodb server.
We can look at databases and work with data.
We connect with default hostname: localhost and Port: 27017.
By default we have admin and local databases,
which are purely for mongodb to do its job.

If facing errors and want to clean up mongo
`brew uninstall mongodb-community mongodb-database-tools mongosh`
"CMD+SHIT+G" while inside finder, then search "/usr/local"

To restart mongodb/brew/mongodb-community after an upgrade:
`brew services restart mongodb/brew/mongodb-community`
Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:
`mongod --config /usr/local/etc/mongod.conf`
