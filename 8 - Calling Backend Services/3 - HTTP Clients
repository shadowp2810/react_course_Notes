In react you need to send HTTP requests to backend
to get or save data.
React is just a simple lightwieght library for building UIs.
All it cares about is rendering the view and managing the DOM.
It makes sure that what we have in Browser DOM is in synch with the Application.
React has no opinion on how to send HTTP requests to server.
This is one of the good things about using React.
You can use the libraries you prefer to send HTTP requests.
In contract in Angular you have HttpModule to send HTTP requests.
Which a lot of people have complaints about.
When using Angular you have to do things the Angular way.
When using React you have the freedome,
the flexibility to use the libraries you prefer.
Most modern browsers have the ability to send HTTP requests using the Fetch API.
Was introduced in recent years and is there is most modern browsers.
Another option we can use is jQuery AJAX.
Another popular library is Axios,
which is what we will be using.
`npm i axios@0.18`
