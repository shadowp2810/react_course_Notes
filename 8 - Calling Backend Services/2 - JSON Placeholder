In this section we use
a fake backend called JSON Placeholder.

`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/`

A fake online REST API for testing and prototyping.
REST stands for Representational State Transfer.
API stands for Application Programming Interface.
This website provides a bunch of endpoints
that are publically acessible over the internet.
You can send HTTP requests to this website
to GET, CREATE, UPDATE and DELETE data, refered to as CRUD operations.
We refer to these endpoints as APIs endpoints.
So they give you an interface to use in your applications.

JSONPlaceholder comes with a set of 6 common resources:
/posts 100 posts
/comments 500 comments
/albums 100 albums
/photos 5000 photos
/todos 200 todos
/users 10 users

https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts
Each objects in posts has 4 properties
"userId", "id", "title", and "body"

You can use JSON view chrome extension to see JSON properly formated.
